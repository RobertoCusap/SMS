# DJANGO Application for sending SMS

## Explanation

This assignment is a Django-based SMS application designed to manage SMS communications. It provides users with a simple interface for managing SMS campaigns efficiently.

We added a virtual environment(venv) called myvenv to install django packages

To run the application: 
in the terminal type **.\myvenv\Scripts\activate** to activate the virtual environment.

After that we run **python manage.py runserver** and the django server will be given.

Then we add **admin** to the server http://127.0.0.1:8000 in order to login in the admin page and it should look like this **http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/**
